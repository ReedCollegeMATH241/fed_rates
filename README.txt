The Fed Rates project aims to predict interest rate changes using text data. Transcripts from the Federal Open Market Committee (the group within the Federal Reserve that sets the target rate) were cleaned up using the tm R package, and words that were determined to make good predictor variables were used to predict interest rate changes using a linear model. The model is checked using minutes of FOMC meetings as well as press conference transcripts. The end result is a simple linear model that predicts a fairly complex phenomena fairly well when given transcripts of spoken word.
